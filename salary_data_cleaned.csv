About the Scholarship
We are seeking a motivated, ambitious and curious PhD candidate for the Australian Research Council funded Discovery Project Holobody: Advancing the Future of Mixed Reality Technologies. The project will pioneer a new approach to human-machine interaction in immersive media (XR) called ‘volumetric capture’ (VI). The project aims generate a completely novel approach to interaction in cyber-physical systems, which will have applications in both XR and robotic systems across a wide range fields, e.g. manufacturing, health and the arts.

The PhD will be located within the vibrant research culture of Swinburne University of Technology’s Centre for Transformative Media Technologies, and supervised by members of the Holobody research team, including Professor Kim Vincs and Dr John McCormick at Swinburne, and Professor Ryszard Kowalczyk, SmartSat CRC Chair, Artificial Intelligence, at Uni SA. The project is embedded within the strongly collaborative framework of Swinburne’s MedTechVic, a $6.7M initiative of the Victorian State Government that connects individuals, organisations and researchers across the assistive and medical technology device sector in Victoria. The candidate will also enjoy support via the CRC SmartSat Artificial Intelligence group at Uni SA. Thus, this PhD project will enjoy strong peer support and collaborative opportunities provided by three rich research cultures, and will be provided with connections to our key international collaborators in these areas.

The Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) is an independent agency within the Attorney-General’s Portfolio, established to support the Integrity Commissioner in carrying out his or her responsibilities for detecting, investigating and preventing corrupt conduct in Australian Government agencies with law enforcement functions. The Integrity Commissioner has extensive powers, including the ability to hold coercive hearings, and ACLEI investigative staff are able to use a range of law enforcement powers to assist in the Integrity Commissioner’s investigations.

At ACLEI, we seek the very best. Attracting and supporting clever, innovative and committed people is essential to ensure ACLEI is well placed to undertake its critical work. We work in a complex and dynamic setting where exceptional judgement and an ability to achieve results are critical.

The Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) is an independent agency within the Attorney-General’s Portfolio, established to support the Integrity Commissioner in carrying out his or her responsibilities for detecting, investigating and preventing corrupt conduct in Australian Government agencies with law enforcement functions. The Integrity Commissioner has extensive powers, including the ability to hold coercive hearings, and ACLEI investigative staff are able to use a range of law enforcement powers to assist in the Integrity Commissioner’s investigations.

At ACLEI, we seek the very best. Attracting and supporting clever, innovative and committed people is essential to ensure ACLEI is well placed to undertake its critical work. We work in a complex and dynamic setting where exceptional judgement and an ability to achieve results are critical.
