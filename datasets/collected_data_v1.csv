As a Senior Data Scientist within our Enterprise Services Division your role will be to solve complex problems and generate sophisticated insights on the performance and health of the bank’s services. As a Senior Data Scientist you will lead a squad of Data Analysts to transform masses of data into actionable operational knowledge for the domains. You will be able to interpret complex data stores and information models, in order to provide data insights which, deliver measurable benefit to the bank.

In a data-driven organisation like ANZ, the Lead Data Scientist will influence the strategy and management of our technology landscape by providing actionable insights which change processes and behaviours. This role will be in the driver’s seat of how the organisation can observe and understand the performance of its end-to-end services, by connecting data from disparate sources to provide a single, clear story to operational teams and executives alike

What will your day look like

Statistical Analytics & Modelling - Advanced modelling, statistics, research and causality to understand complex data problems relating to the performance of the bank’s services. This will include approaching operational problems with left-field thinking, where they are able to look for macro trends in the industry and region, not simply to the data contained within our IT Service Management systems

Data Analysis - Translating data into insights and using it to make better business decisions and to deliver customer/user centric solutions.

Engagement Personalisation - Delivering automated, connected and personalised engagements across content, experiences and product offerings through data driven insights into customer behaviours and needs. Will be the face of the Data Science team and an advocate and evangelist on data quality, governance and insights.

Solution Design - Designing technical and non-technical solutions to resolve a problem or meet a customer need

What will you bring?

Experience in creating advanced analytics modelling (e.g. supervised/unsupervised machine learning) and its use in business contexts

Experience working with state-of-the-art Technology and an in-depth knowledge of machine learning methods to understand and predict customer/user behaviour

Experience in preparing and combining data using SQL and NoSQL

Experience in delivering strategic solutions to join large numbers of disparate datasets together to answer complex business problems

Data Governance, Quality & Control skills and experience

Data test automation capabilities

Strong communication and presentation skills to translate analysis into insights and present findings

Process automation, deep system expertise, forensic mindset

Ability to effectively communicate to all stakeholders (technical and non-technical)

Mastery with Business Intelligence software e.g. Tableau, Qlik

Strong understanding of IT Service Management and IT Asset Management, including ServiceNow data model, the Common Service Data Model (CSDM) and ITIL 4

You’re not expected to have 100% of these skills. At ANZ a growth mindset is at the heart of our culture and we actively encourage people to try new things. So, if this role interests you and you feel you have most of these things in your toolbox, we’d love to hear from you.

So, why join us?

At ANZ, everything we do boils down to ‘why’ – our purpose – to shape a world where people and communities thrive. We're just as focused on seeing our people thrive as well as our customers. We'll give you every opportunity to develop your career.

We are responding faster to changing customer requirements, focusing on the things that matter the most, energising our people, eliminating waste and reducing bureaucracy.

A happy workplace is a thriving one. So to attract and keep the best talent, and say thanks for the hard work, we make sure all our employees are rewarded.

We work flexibly at ANZ and encourage you to talk to us about how this role can be flexible for you. Some of the work we do can be done from home, and some from an ANZ workplace – it’s all about what works for your team, and above all else, our customers!

We want to make sure everyone has an inclusive and supportive experience throughout our recruitment process and when joining ANZ. If you are a candidate with a disability, and require adjustments to our recruitment process or the role itself let us know how we can provide you with additional support.

This role is required to work from an ANZ workplace. Under the Victorian Government’s COVID-19 Mandatory Vaccination (Workers) Directions, the successful candidate will need to provide evidence that they have received two doses of an approved COVID-19 vaccine, or have a medical exemption evidenced on the Australian Immunization Register, in order to be appointed to the role.
